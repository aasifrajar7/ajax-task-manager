The /ajax-task-manager/ajax-task-manager/vendor directory is automatically generated by Composer when you install your PHP dependencies. It typically contains the libraries and packages that your project depends on, and it is not meant to be manually edited or created with specific contents.

Therefore, this directory is intentionally left blank.
